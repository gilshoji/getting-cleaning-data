# The Project

I need to work with some datasets and create final one dataset following 5 steps:
1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
